** UI1.0 Structure
   This template is to standardize the formats of all labs according
   to the homogeneous hosting framework. It helps you achieve the following:

- *Coding standards:* The template ensures that lab developers follow
  good programming practices to make the code of the labs efficient
  and readable.
- *Upgrading widgets and components:* The template makes it easy for
  lab developers to modify and update widgets and/or components.
- *Unified look and feel:* The UI 1.0 template offers a uniform user
  interface for authoring and interacting with the virtual labs. It
  also provides labs a simple and uniform web interface and a
  homogeneous hosting framework.
- *Provision for better versions of template:* In future, if advanced
  versions of the UI template are created, the lab developers can
  transfer the lab content automatically as per the new versions.
** UI3.0 Structure
   Has to be updated by Sonali

** Amritha Structure
   - There are few labs which are in collaborative framework, We can
     identify them using lab URL it looks like the following
   - Lab URL should contain the fields like sub, brch, sim and cnt.
   For example, the URL of the lab

   =http://iitkgp.vlab.co.in/?sub=39&brch=124&sim=922&cnt=1=

   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | url format                                        | example                                            |
   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | sub=39(subjects or domains)                       | Electrical Engineering                             |
   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | brch=124(branch or lab)                           | Analog Signals, Network and Measurement Laboratory |
   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | sim=922(experiment)                               | Verification of Superposition Theorem              |
   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
   | cnt=1(the breakup of pages under each experiment) | Introduction, Aim, Theory etc                      |
   |---------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------|

   - If your lab does not follow this format, you can assume that your lab has an unstructured format.
   
   - There are 5 labs which are need to be converted to UI1.0 either
     using scripts or manually as scripts are not functioning.
** Unstructured Labs
   - The structure of these labs is neither in =UI1.0,UI3.0= nor in =Amrutha= fomat.
   - Instead lab developers followed their own structure to build the lab.
   - We are converting these unstructured labs into UI1.0 manually.
   - So far we have converted 2 labs into =UI1.0= remaining labs to be converted 8.
